# Problem Statement
## Objectives
Build a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will convert (e.g., make a purchase, converted = 1) based on their metrics: ads_click (number of ads clicks), time_on_site (time spent on the website in minutes), and pages_visited (number of pages visited). The model will help optimize marketing strategies by identifying high-potential customers.

## Business Context
An e-commerce company wants to predict customer conversion to prioritize marketing efforts, improve user experience, and increase sales. The model will be deployed via a Streamlit app for real-time predictions, with MLflow used to track experiments and Git/GitHub for version control.

## Success Criteria
Achieve a model with at least 80% accuracy, track experiments for reproducibility, and deploy a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to input customer data and receive conversion predictions.
